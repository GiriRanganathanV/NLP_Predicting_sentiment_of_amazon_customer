# Predicting_sentiment_of_amazon_customer

# Objective:
The objective of the project is to build machine learning models using NLP techniques to predict the sentiment of amazon customer and compare the models based on their accuracy. 

# Data overview: 
The data set consists of 11 attributes and 10683 observations. The dataset needs preprocessing since it consists of missing values and also outlier treatment is required to handle the outliers before building the models.

# Workflow:
Data preparation and exploratory data analysis   
Converting text into vectors using NLP & handling class imbalance  
Building logistic regression model using countvectorizer and TFIDF  
Comparing countvectorizer technique & TFIDF to select the suitable one  
Implementing multiple machine learning models and predicting the accuracy  

# Machine learning models implemented:
Linear regression  
KNN  
Decision tree  
RandomForest
